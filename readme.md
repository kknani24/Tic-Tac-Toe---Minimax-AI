## Project Overview
This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It offers a minimalist design for casual play and supports two modes: **Single Player**, where you play against an AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, and **Multiplayer**, where two players can play together on the same machine.



## Technologies Used

Here are the key technologies and libraries used in this project:

### **Python**

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Once the program starts, Player X will go first by clicking any square in the 3x3 grid.
2. **AI or Player O's Turn**: In **Single Player Mode**, the AI will make the next move. In **Multiplayer Mode**, Player O will click to make their move.
3. **Winning the Game**: A player wins by aligning three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. **Draw**: If all squares are filled without a winner, the game will end in a draw.
